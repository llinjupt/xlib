# xlib
An eXtended C library of collected functions about genral String, Memory, DB, 
Algorithm, Net and etc. operations.

Not like glibc which is a huge and complex lib, this xlib is a tiny extened
function groups, used for general Unix-Like OS, especially for Embedded systems. 
It aims to help engineens develop a C program quickly and canonically. Lots of
functions were enlightened by other open source projects.

There are a lot of parts listed below. And will be extended day after day.

1. Character, String  and file functions with security checking.
2. Very genral and convenient bitmap fucntions.
3. A tiny memory tracking system. 
4. An useful logging and debugging system: xdebug and xlogxxx.
5. Data Structure: list, array , heap and queue functions
6. Net functions with ip/mac address. 
7. TCP/UDP functions encapsulated for quick network operations
8. CRC, Hash and base64 algrithms
9. An system-like funtion xexccmd.c help to call other cmd quickly.
10. ...
